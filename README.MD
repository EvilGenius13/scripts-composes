## Current Scripts
- docker-portainer.sh
(Installs Docker, Docker-Compose, and Portainer)
To use, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvilGenius13/scripts-composes/main/scripts/docker-portainer.sh | bash
```
If you hit a part in the script asking to restart kernels, just hit enter and it will continue.
When the script is complete, double check that portainer is running on the port. If it is, the installation is complete.
I recommend running `sudo reboot` to restart the system and finish the kernel updates.
